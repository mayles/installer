OpenXT repository structure
######################################################################

The OpenXT software is read from a structured repository, that is
a directory named "packages.main" containing three metadata files:

"XC-REPOSITORY" contains the version information of the software.
It currently has eight lines:
1: "xc:main" to identify this as the main install repository.
2: "pack:Base Pack" as a human readable identity string.
3: "product:OpenXT" as another human readable identity string.
4: "build:${BuildID}" to indicate the software version.
5: "version:${Version}" to indicate the software version.
6: "release:${Release}" to indicate the software version.
7: "upgrade-from:${Releases}" to indicate the previous software versions from
   which upgrade is allowed.
8: "packages:${Checksum}" as a SHA256 checksum of the "XC-PACKAGES" file.

"XC-PACKAGES" lists the individual package files contained in the
packages.main directory that are to be installed.

Each line of the packages file contains the following data:

<component id> <file size> <sha256sum> <package format> [required|optional] <filename> <destination dir>

eg:
dom0 15280767 c665cbb74c7f644fa5191adeb8664d37a0439ef9b1c39da40ef2e5a14a40d88b ext2bz2 required dom0-rootfs.i686.ext2.bz2 /

The itemization of the repository contents enables verification
of the integrity of the package files during installation.

"XC-SIGNATURE" contains a signature of the "XC-REPOSITORY" file.

The signature, together with the checksum of the "XC-PACKAGES" file
in the "XC-REPOSITORY" file, enable verification of the integrity of
the metadata files.

The packages.main directory is at the top level of the installation
ISO. This directory can be copied to a http, ftp or NFS server to
enable network installation by providing the network location to
the installer. When supplying the location to the installer, the
"packages.main" suffix must be omitted.
